## 🧠 Project Title:
**EduBot — A Simple Study Helper Chatbot**

---

## 💡 Description:
EduBot is a **beginner-friendly Python chatbot** that answers basic study-related questions.  
It’s designed to help users practice **Python fundamentals** — including **conditionals, loops, data types, data structures,** and **control statements** — while creating a fun, interactive project.

## 🧩 Concepts Demonstrated:
| Concept | Example in Code | Explanation |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Conditionals** | `if`, `elif`, `else` | Used to decide how EduBot responds to different user inputs. |
| **Control Statements** | `break`, `continue` | `break` ends the chat; `continue` skips to the next user input. |
| **Data Types** | `str`, `dict` | User input is a string; responses are stored in a dictionary. |
| **Data Structures** | `dictionary` | Holds EduBot’s predefined responses (key-value pairs). |
| **Loops** | `while True` | Keeps the chatbot running until the user types “bye”. |
