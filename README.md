# 📘 EduBot — Simple Chatbot in Python

## 🧠 Project Title:
**EduBot — A Simple Study Helper Chatbot**

---

## 💡 Description:
EduBot is a **simple interactive chatbot** built using **Python**, designed to answer basic study-related questions.  
This project is ideal for beginners learning the **fundamentals of programming** — including conditionals, control flow, loops, data types, and data structures.

The chatbot uses a **dictionary** to store predefined responses and a **while loop** to maintain an ongoing conversation with the user.  
It demonstrates how logic and repetition can be used to create interactive programs without the need for external libraries or advanced frameworks.

EduBot not only helps you understand basic **Python logic**, but also shows how such logic forms the foundation for more complex **AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing)** systems.

## 🎯 Key Features:
- Responds to user input on common study-related topics  
- Runs continuously until the user types `bye`  
- Demonstrates clean and simple Python logic  
- Uses conditionals, loops, and dictionaries  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to expand with new questions and answers

## 🧩 Concepts Demonstrated:
| Concept | Example in Code | Explanation |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Conditionals** | `if`, `elif`, `else` | Used to decide how EduBot responds to different user inputs. |
| **Control Statements** | `break`, `continue` | `break` ends the chat; `continue` skips to the next user input. |
| **Data Types** | `str`, `dict` | User input is a string; responses are stored in a dictionary. |
| **Data Structures** | `dictionary` | Holds EduBot’s predefined responses (key-value pairs). |
| **Loops** | `while True` | Keeps the chatbot running until the user types “bye”. |

## ⚙️ How to Run the Program:

1. Make sure you have **Python** installed on your computer (Python 3.7 or newer).  
   You can check this by typing:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```
2. Save the chatbot code as `simple_chatbot.py`.

3. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the file’s folder, and run:
   ```bash
   python simple_chatbot.py
   ```

4. Start chatting with EduBot!  
   Type your questions (e.g. *“how to focus”*, *“give motivation”*, *“tips for exams”*)  
   Type **bye** to exit the program.

## 🗣️ Example Chat:

```
Hello! I’m EduBot 🤖 — your study helper chatbot!
Ask me anything about studying, or type 'bye' to exit.

You: hello
EduBot: Hi there! How are you today?

You: how to focus
EduBot: Try removing distractions, set short goals, and take breaks every 25 minutes (Pomodoro method).

You: bye
EduBot: Goodbye! 👋 Stay motivated and keep studying!
```
